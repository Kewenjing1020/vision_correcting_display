We propose a novel framework for vision-correcting display to free eye-movement within a specified viewing zone, while compensating for low-order optical eye aberration (\ie, myopia and hyperopia). We summarize our contributions as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item We propose a framework for vision-correcting display that captures light field of a virtual image placed at eyeâ€™s focal plane. Light rays entering a viewing zone are represented by the light field signal so that viewing point is free to move within the viewing zone to view the display in focus.
\item We explore a design space to build a view-independent vision correcting display, providing trade-offs among size of viewing zone, of virtual image, and of the display. An analysis of minimum spatial and angular resolution requirements of the display to compensate for low-order eye aberration is also presented.
